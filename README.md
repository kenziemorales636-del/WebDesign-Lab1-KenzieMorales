Reflection on Understanding Website and Web Application, Repositories, and Documentation: Preparing for the Modern Office

Studying the subject Web Design for my Office Administration program helped me to better understand how complex digital tools can be, how important it is to learn about websites and web applications, especially in our modern world where technology is mostly used, and how it should be used responsibly.

What is a website, and how is it different from a web application?

Initially, I learned that a website is like an online brochure where users can read information. It's a collection of interconnected web pages accessible through the internet, serving as a dedicated online space for sharing information, images, and videos. Websites are primarily designed to present information and communicate with visitors. They can be personal, educational, commercial, or organizational, depending on their purpose. For instance, a school website might feature announcements, student resources, and contact details, while a business site showcases products or services.

However, I also learned that a website is different from a web application. While both are accessible through a browser, their functions are not the same. A website is mostly informational, meaning it shares and displays data to users. On the other hand, web application is interactive, allowing users to perform tasks or manipulate data online. Examples of web applications include Google Docs, Facebook, and online banking systems, where I can log in, edit, and save information. In short, a website tells you something, while a web application lets you do something. This interactivity is the key difference that I noticed.

Why do you think organizations (like offices or schools) need websites? 

Consequently, I saw why offices and schools use these tools; it is because they are effective tools for communication, transparency, and accessibility. Specifically for offices, a website helps them share company information, job openings, or updates with clients and employees. Moreover, it strengthens their professional image and makes their services more visible to the public. Similarly, for schools, websites are essential for publishing announcements, academic calendars, enrollment details, and online learning resources. It helps to connect students, teachers, and parents in one accessible platform.

What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository? How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?

As a student new to GitHub, creating my first repository is quite challenging. The most difficult parts were the confusing technical language and the fear of making a mistake that could ruin my project. However, I quickly discovered that writing a good README file is incredibly helpful. It’s like writing a simple instruction manual. This makes me write down the project's goal and how to set it up clearly, which is a core administrative skill that I believe will ensure my future projects—and my future office’s projects—are easy for anyone, including my future self, to understand and manage.

In summary, I see that websites have become an important part of modern communication. They provide easy access to information anytime and anywhere, making both schools and offices more efficient and connected. Furthermore, understanding the distinction between a website and a web application helps me appreciate how technology continues to evolve—from simply presenting information to creating interactive, user-centered online experiences.
